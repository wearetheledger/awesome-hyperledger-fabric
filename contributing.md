# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the thing you're submitting and why it should be included.**
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- If you're submitting a closed source app, include evidence of it being built with Hyperledger Fabric.
- The "Closed Source" section has a very high bar for acceptance. You're a lot more likely to get accepted if you link to a blog post on how you built the app.
- Submitted packages should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[title](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant section.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't mention `Hyperledger Fabric` in the description as it's implied.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one.
